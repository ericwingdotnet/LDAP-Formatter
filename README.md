# LDAP-Tool
PHP Command-line script for retrieving LDAP records and outputting an XML formatted result. These results are well formed, but do not adhere to any particular Schema. The XML Elements take their names from the LDAP attributes. Their are also Element Attributes in the root element (people) for the record count and the timestamp of the data generation.

### Future Development

This is part of a project where I would like to introduce other data formats like JSON and CSV and take the LDAP filter as a separate file. This could form a reusable tool for the command line to generate directory information in a variety of formats.

### Data Security

A note on data security. LDAP queries frequently return Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Extreme care should be taken with what happens to the information generated by this script. Never store this data beyond protected organisational areas. DO NOT USE THIS TO PUBLISH TO THE WEB (public_html). Use it on the command line inside secure directories only.
